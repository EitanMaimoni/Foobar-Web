Facebook web

How we did it:
Each team member was responsible for creating a specific page: login, signup, and the feed. Once individual tasks were completed, we collaborated to assist one another in finalizing each section. Subsequently, we began the process of integrating these pages into a single, cohesive website. This led to the creation of a basic, functional webpage. From there, we focused on refining and enhancing the site, incrementally introducing small features until we achieved our final product. Throughout this development process, we implemented testing to ensure the quality and functionality of our website.

How to run it:
To run the website, ensure that npm is installed on your computer. Then, in the terminal within the project directory, execute the command 'npm start'.
